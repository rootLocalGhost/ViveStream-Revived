# Application Architecture

## Overview

ViveStream Revived is an Electron-based application that follows a standard multi-process architecture:

1. **Main Process (Node.js)**: Controls the application lifecycle, manages the database, performs file operations, and spawns child processes for heavy lifting (downloads, conversions).
2. **Renderer Process (Plain JavaScript)**: Handles the user interface. It is sandboxed and communicates with the Main Process strictly via the `ContextBridge`.
3. **Child Processes**: External binaries (Python/yt-dlp, FFmpeg) managed by the Main Process.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Process (`src/main/`)

The backend logic is split into three core modules:

- **`main.js`**: The entry point.
  - Initializes the `BrowserWindow`.
  - Sets up IPC event listeners (`ipcMain`).
  - Manages native menus and tray icons.
  - Handles "single instance" locking.
- **`database.js`**: Data persistence layer.
  - Uses `knex` as a query builder.
  - Uses `sqlite3` as the database engine.
  - Manages schema migrations and relational data (Videos <-> Artists, Videos <-> Playlists).
- **`utils.js`**: Utility belt.
  - Wraps `yt-dlp` for downloading content.
  - Wraps `ffmpeg` for media processing.
  - Handles file system operations (path sanitization, cleanup).

### 2. The Bridge (`src/preload/`)

To maintain security, the Renderer process has **no direct access** to Node.js APIs. We expose a safe API via `preload.js`:

```javascript
// Exposing a specific function, not the entire 'fs' module
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('api', {
  downloadVideo: (url) => ipcRenderer.send('download-video', url),
  onProgress: (callback) => ipcRenderer.on('download-progress', callback),
});
```

### 3. Renderer (`src/renderer/`)

The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does not use any modern frameworks like React or Vue.

- **State Management**: Uses a custom `state.js` (lightweight store).
- **Routing**: Simple conditional rendering based on user actions.
- **Styling**: Plain CSS.

## Data Flow: The Download Lifecycle

1. **UI Trigger**: User inputs a URL and clicks "Download".
2. **IPC Request**: Renderer calls `window.api.downloadVideo(url)`.
3. **Validation**: Main Process (`ipc.js`) validates the URL.
4. **Metadata Fetch**: Main calls `utils.getVideoInfo(url)` (spawns `yt-dlp --dump-json`).
5. **DB Insert**: A record is created in `videos` table with status "pending".
6. **Download**: Main spawns `yt-dlp` process.
   - `stdout` is parsed for progress percentage.
   - Progress is sent to Renderer via `win.webContents.send('download-progress', ...)`.
7. **Post-Processing**: If needed, `ffmpeg` is spawned to convert/merge formats.
8. **Finalization**:
   - File is moved to the library folder.
   - DB record updated to "completed".
   - `library-updated` event sent to Renderer.

## "Vendor" Binary Management

A unique feature of this project is how it handles dependencies like `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp`.

- **No Runtime Downloads**: We do **not** download binaries at runtime. This ensures offline capability and security.
- **Git LFS**: Large binaries are stored in `vendor/<platform>/` and tracked with Git LFS.
- **Build-Time Injection**:
  - `helpers/builder.js` detects the target platform.
  - It copies the specific binaries from `vendor/<platform>/` into the app's `resources` folder.
  - `utils.js` detects the OS at runtime and locates the binaries relative to `process.resourcesPath`.

## Build System

We use a custom wrapper around `electron-builder` (`helpers/builder.js`) to handle complex cross-platform requirements:

- **Windows**: Injects a portable Python environment (`python-portable/`) so users don't need Python installed.
- **Linux**: Supports AppImage, Deb, RPM, Snap.
- **macOS**: Handles DMG creation.

See [Build System](./BUILD_SYSTEM.md) for details.
