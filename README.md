## 🚀 Core Features

- 📥 **Versatile Downloader:**
  - **YouTube & More:** Download videos and entire playlists from YouTube and other supported sites. ViveStream automatically creates local playlists for you.
  - **Smart Downloads:** Already have a video? ViveStream skips re-downloading it but updates its "date added" so it appears with the rest of its playlist.
  - **Import Local Files:** Add your existing media files from your computer directly into the ViveStream library. Thumbnails are automatically generated for local videos.
- ✂️ **Advanced Download Controls:**
  - Clip specific sections using start/end times.
  - Automatically split videos by their chapters into individual files.
  - Remove sponsored segments, intros, and outros with SponsorBlock integration.
  - Download subtitles for videos (official and auto-generated).
  - Use cookies from your browser to access members-only or age-restricted content.
- 📚 **Robust Library Management:**
  - **Powerful Search:** Instantly find what you're looking for with fuzzy search across videos, artists, and playlists. Results are neatly organized by category.
  - **Advanced Filtering:** Filter your library and favorites by media type (video/audio), duration, and source (YouTube/local).
  - **Full Metadata Control:** Edit titles, artists, and descriptions with a seamless inline editor directly on the player page.
  - **Playlists:** Create custom playlists, add media with a drag-and-drop interface, and upload custom cover images.
  - **Artists:** Media is automatically sorted by artist. Upload custom profile images for your favorite creators.
  - **Favorites:** A dedicated, filterable section for your most-loved content.
- 🎬 **High-Performance Integrated Player:**
  - **Context-Aware Queue:** When you play from a playlist, artist page, or favorites, the "Up Next" queue is intelligently populated and visually grouped.
  - **Gapless Playback:** Intelligent preloading ensures seamless, uninterrupted playback.
  - **Sleep Timer:** Set a timer to stop playback after a certain number of tracks, a set duration in minutes, or at a specific time of day.
  - **System Media Keys:** Control playback with your keyboard's media keys, even when the app is in the background.
  - **Full Feature Set:** Includes theater mode, fullscreen, miniplayer, playback speed control, and subtitle support.
- ⚙️ **Maintenance & Customization:**
  - **Smart Installer (Windows):** A professional setup experience with options to run on startup and launch after install.
  - **Visual Progress:** Monitor the progress of large file imports and library exports with a real-time progress bar.
  - **Export Library:** Save a copy of any media file or your entire library to another location, with files named by their proper titles.
  - **Reinitialize App:** A one-click function to clear the app's cache, rescan media files, and clean up any orphaned entries from the database.
- 📦 **All-in-One & Standalone:** No need to install Python, yt-dlp, or FFmpeg separately. Everything is bundled and ready to go via our **Portable Python Architecture**.

## 📥 Installation

### Recommended Method (Installer)

> **⚠️ Note:** If you are using ViveStream v7.6.0 or lower, please **uninstall** the old version before installing this one. Recent versions contain significant architectural changes. Installing on top of an old version may result in duplicate installations.

1. Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Md-Siam-Mia-Man/ViveStream-Revived/releases) page.
2. Download the installer for your OS:
   - **Windows:** `ViveStream-Setup-x.x.x.exe`
   - **Linux:** `.AppImage`, `.deb`, or `.rpm`
   - **macOS:** `.dmg`
3. Run the installer.

#### 🗑️ Uninstallation & Data

- **Windows:** The uninstaller will ask if you want to keep or delete your media library and database.
- **Linux / macOS:** Due to OS limitations, uninstalling the app **does not** automatically remove your downloaded media (`~/ViveStream`) or database.
  - **Tip:** Go to **Settings > Danger Zone > Clear All Media** & **Delete Database** inside the app _before_ uninstalling if you want a clean slate.
